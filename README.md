# Foundational LLM for Code Generation & Documentation Assistance

This project details the development of a specialized Large Language Model (LLM) based on the Transformer architecture, built from scratch and tailored for internal code generation and technical documentation understanding. It showcases advanced techniques in model implementation, custom data preprocessing, large-scale distributed training using PyTorch DDP, and efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

**Problem:** General-purpose LLMs often lack deep understanding of proprietary codebases or specialized technical domains. A domain-specific model can provide more accurate code suggestions, better documentation summaries, and more relevant assistance, boosting developer productivity.

**Solution:** We implemented a decoder-only Transformer model inspired by architectures like GPT-2/GPT-Neo. Custom data pipelines were built to preprocess large internal code repositories and technical documents, creating a high-quality training corpus. The model was trained from scratch using PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) across multiple GPU nodes. Subsequently, the foundational model was fine-tuned using LoRA for specific downstream tasks like code summarization and potential bug identification, achieving state-of-the-art results on internal evaluation benchmarks.

**Key Features:**

*   **Transformer Implementation:** Built core Transformer components (Self-Attention, Feed-Forward layers, Positional Encoding) in PyTorch.
*   **Custom Data Preprocessing:** Developed tailored tokenization and processing pipelines for Python code and technical Markdown/LaTeX documents.
*   **Distributed Training:** Utilized PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) for efficient multi-GPU training, enabling training of larger models on larger datasets.
*   **Training From Scratch:** Managed the complexities of training a large language model, including learning rate scheduling, gradient clipping, and checkpointing.
*   **Efficient Fine-Tuning:** Implemented Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to adapt the foundational model to specific tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.
*   **Downstream Task Adaptation:** Fine-tuned for practical developer tasks like code summarization and preliminary bug pattern detection.

**Tech Stack:**

*   **Languages:** Python
*   **ML Frameworks:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers (for tokenizers, comparison), DeepSpeed (Optional, for advanced optimization)
*   **NLP Libraries:** Tokenizers (Hugging Face), NLTK/spaCy (for text preprocessing)
*   **Distributed Computing:** PyTorch Distributed (DDP), NCCL
*   **Hardware:** Multi-GPU Server (e.g., 4x V100/A100) or Cloud GPU Instances (AWS P3/G4, GCP A2/N1)

**Results:**

*   Successfully trained a functional domain-specific LLM from scratch.
*   Demonstrated effective distributed training scaling across multiple GPUs.
*   Achieved state-of-the-art performance on internal code summarization and bug detection benchmarks via LoRA fine-tuning.
